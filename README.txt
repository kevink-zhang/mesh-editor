HW 6:

Taking late day

Extra credit implemented: sharp edges/vertices/faces and sharpness

The three checkboxes toggle sharpness for the displayed edge/vertex/face. For face, toggling from not-sharp to sharp makes all vertices and edges inside the face sharp, and toggling from sharp to not-sharp makes all vertices and edges inside the face not-sharp.

There is also a spin box on the bottom that allows the user to modify the sharpness value. The updated value is applied on the next Catmull-Clark transformation.
